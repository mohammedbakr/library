## About Library

This is a Library App using Laravel-framework based on Test driven Development with phpunit testing.
I did the test first to get from green to red then code to get to green again, repeat this all time and that's the beauty of TDD.
Tests done for Authors, Books, Users and checking out and in for reservation books.
Still not done with views, installed vue and tailwind to learn them too, but my focus was on testing not UI
My first trial for TDD, hope you like it.
